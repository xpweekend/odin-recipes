# odin-recipes

This is the recipe project from TOP to close the basics of HTML and move onto the basics of CSS.

In this projects, I set up first the landing page by using the name 'index.html', which automatically tells the browser that is the landing page.
I also made another directory within the directory index sits, samed 'recipes', which contain other html files with different recipes I can link to the landing page using a relative link.

Boilerplate at this point is memorised, but it's much easier to just '!' then 'Tab' to get the template, the change the title and add stuff to it.

Index page is very bare, only consists of the boilerplate, an h1 element, and unordered list, and the relative links to the 3 recipe pages.

The mango sorbet page was first and also used the '!' and 'Tab' for the boilerplate, and I followed the instructions on TOP on how it should look, and created a template out ot if, which I would then use on the other 2 recipe pages, but just changing the containerized stuff that the user can see to match the recipe, but the overall code did not change, just extra or fewer 'li' elements.

There were 4 iterations on the website, and per iteration I made sure to 'git add .' and 'git commit' and add either just a title or a title and body depending on how many new things were added in that iteration following best practices and some GPT help so my commits are decent. I think they are pretty okay for my first REAL sort of project. Still hand-holdy, but less step by step hand holding from projects at fCC I did, and more 'You should have this, this and that. Go ham.' Which I kinda I like, but I also don't know if it's easy, as I've already done all of this in fCC, and may struggle with new content that is less hand-holdy when it comes to CSS or JS, but we will see.

The Project so far has been... boring, unfortunatedly. It's a lot of reading for foundation, but when i got into the coding stuff, it picked up, and then git, picked up again even more, and then it slowed a little with best practices and so on, but picked up again with the project to close the basics in HTML. fCC kinda throws you into the code editor and tells you what to do step by step with videos and quizes, where as TOP tells you the theory, shows you videos and articles, and doesn't necessarily test your knowledge on it, it gives you questions to look back on if you forgot or skipped, but it's a very different learning experience for sure. TOP is also VERY detailed. Currently 43% completed with foundations and that took almost a week, where as getting to this point in fCC took me max 2 days, and it was pretty much all coding. Though I feel like both are valuable and neither is better, I'm sticking with TOP till the end of foundation, then through and to the end of the JS path, after which I will go back and supplement with fCC as it has a much more in-depth full-stack path.

Learning outcomes so far?
Basics of HTML such as boilerplate, elements, terms such as absolute and relative links, basics of git including add, logs, commit -m and through text editor, and general knowledge and teachings on 'learn to learn' and 'don't rely on AI for answers, but to teach you', setting up a github, joining the discord and partaking in the community and... that's all for now. Excited for the future.
